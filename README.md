## Description
I prepared this project myself. My portfolio was initially made as a project for studies, then i decided to move my design to some framework, fix all bugs and add some features, to use it as my personal portfolio.<br/>
Graphics visible in the background of the start section, graphics of the contact section and graphics presenting the technologies I use have been shared by the authors under a public license.<br/>
The other graphics, i.e. the logo visible in the upper left corner and button graphics, were created by myself using Inkscape.<br/>
The code of this project is public, so everyone can copy it and use for their own projects. The use of this design for commercial purposes is not allowed.
